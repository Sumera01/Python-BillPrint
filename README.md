# Python-BillPrint
🍽️ Restaurant Billing System – Python Project
I developed this Restaurant Billing System during my early Python learning phase to automate order processing and billing. This command-line program allows users to view the menu, place orders, and generate bills efficiently.

💻 Key Features:
✅ 📜 Menu Display – Users can filter the menu by Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian, or All Items.
✅ 🛒 Ordering System – Customers can add multiple items to their order dynamically.
✅ 💰 Automatic Billing – Calculates the total amount based on selected items.
✅ 📋 Well-Formatted Bill – Displays the final bill with item-wise pricing.

🚀 Tech Stack: Python (CLI-based program)

This project enhanced my understanding of loops, dictionaries, user input handling, and formatted output in Python.
