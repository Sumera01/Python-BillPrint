## 📖 About the Project  
**Python-BillPrint** is a beginner-friendly command-line application that simulates a *restaurant billing system*.  
It allows the user to:  
✅ View the menu  
✅ Filter items (Veg / Non-Veg / All)  
✅ Select multiple items  
✅ Automatically generate a clean final bill  

This project was created to practise **Python basics** like loops, dictionaries, conditional logic, and formatted output.

---

## ✨ Features  
- Display restaurant menu with category filters  
- Take multiple orders in one session  
- Auto calculate total bill  
- Nicely formatted bill output (Item | Qty | Price | Amount)  
- Pure Python — no external libraries required  
- Beginner-friendly and easy to extend

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
| Component | Used |
|-----------|------|
| Language  | Python 3 |
| Interface | Command Line (CLI) |
| Libraries | Only Python standard library |

---

## 🎯 Why I Built This  
✔ To improve real-world problem-solving in Python  
✔ To create a small but functional portfolio project  
✔ To simulate real billing logic (menu, orders, total, etc.)  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### ✅ Prerequisites  
- Python 3.7 or above installed  
- Basic knowledge of running `.py` files

### ▶️ Run the Project  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sumera01/Python-BillPrint.git
cd Python-BillPrint
python bill.py
````

---

## 🧠 Usage

1. Run the script
2. Choose Veg / Non-Veg / All
3. Select items and quantity
4. View final generated bill
5. Restart program for next order (optional)

---

## 🔍 How It Works

* Menu is stored in a **dictionary** (item → price → type)
* User input is taken in a loop
* Items and quantities are stored in a list
* Final bill is calculated & printed with structured formatting
* No database — lightweight and simple
